Question 2:
Part a: My selection sort is not stable because once I swap the relative order 
        is not maintained. For instance, lets say I had the elements 9, 1, 1 in 
        an array. If I called selection sort on the array, the 9 would swap with
        the last 1 causing the array to not maintain relative order.

Part b: You could test it with a vector with the elements 6, 6, 2. In this case,
        my sort function would swap the first 6 with the 2 at the end. This 
        would cause it to not be stable.
